- Script to compare original MacArthur geocoded points data with 2.0 geocoded lines data from Dec 2018

# Cambodia_MergeData

- script to merge all of the 5km cell level extracts from the original MacArthur analysis, since cell location and much of the outcome and covariate data has not changed
- includes extracts with Hansen forest loss data, ndvi, ntl, temp, precip, plantations, protected areas, concessions
- original analysis had incorrect dmsp ntl data as a covar (because there was an error in data on sciclone), but this ntl data is correct
- also included pre-trends for ntl and ndvi
